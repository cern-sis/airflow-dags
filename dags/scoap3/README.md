# Workflows

The following image describes the process for each publishers. Please note that the number of tasks is the minimum, more tasks can be implemented if the need raises.

## Run with docker-compose

The easiest way to run the project is run in with docker compose.
For it docker-compose has to be installed.After just run in it the command bellow:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Currently the docker-compose performance isn't very good. Thus, for local dev, it is advised to run it locally.

## Run it locally

We need to install airflow.

1. First, we need to install poetry:

   ```
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

   ```

2. Install pyenv, the instruction can be found [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)
3. Export correct python version by using pyenv:
   ```
   export PYTHON_VERSION = 3.10.11
   pyenv install ${PYTHON_VERSION}
   pyenv global $(PYTHON_VERSION)
   ```
4. Set airflow home directory:

   ```
   export AIRFLOW_HOME=${PWD}
   ```

5. Install dependencies listed in pyproject.toml file by running the command:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```
6. Run Airflow. Airflow comes with the `standalone` command. This should not be used as it seems to use the SequentialExecutor by default. To have our local config being use, we must run all services together :

   ```
       poetry run airflow webserver
       poetry run airflow triggerer
       poetry run airflow scheduler
   ```

### Script

A Makefile has been created to ease this process. The available targets are the following :

- `make init` : Inits the pyenv version and virtual env.
- `make start` : Starts all processes needed.
- `make stop` : Stops all processes needed.
- `make create_user` : create a new user with all the parameters

## Access UI

Airflow UI will be rinning on localhost:8080.
More details about Airflow installation and running can be found [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/local.html)
